# Learning Material 📚💻

> A tidy home for my notes, experiments, and code snippets — organized, searchable, and fun to explore. ✨

## Why this repo? 🚀
- Keep all learning resources and practice code in one place
- Track progress over time and revisit fundamentals
- Share snippets, tips, and tiny projects that spark curiosity 💡

## What's inside 🧭
- Notes and cheat-sheets on concepts I’m studying
- Small, focused code examples and experiments
- Links to resources worth re-reading 🔗

## Structure 🗂️
Suggested layout (I’ll grow this organically):
- `notes/` — topic summaries, references, and quick guides
- `snippets/` — minimal examples that demonstrate a concept
- `projects/` — small practice apps and challenges
- `resources/` — articles, videos, and bookmarks

## Getting started 🧪
- Browse folders by topic and language
- Run examples directly (each snippet/project includes simple instructions)
- Use this as a personal “learning vault” — add, tweak, iterate

## Goals & Roadmap 🎯
- Build a habit of daily micro-learning
- Favor tiny, runnable examples over long theory-only notes
- Periodically refactor folders for clarity and discoverability

## Contributing 🤝
- Future me (and friends) are welcome to open PRs
- Keep examples small, well-explained, and runnable
- Add tags or brief intros so content is easy to find

## License 📄
- Personal learning repository; treat content with respect
- If you reuse snippets, a shout-out is always appreciated 🙏

Enjoy the journey — one concept at a time. 🌱🔥
